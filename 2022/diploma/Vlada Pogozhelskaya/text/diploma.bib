techniques. Given a graph and a query defined over a context-free grammar, our algorithm
identifies paths on the graph which form words of the language generated by the grammar.
We show that our algorithm is correct. We conduct performance evaluation experiments
with some popular ontologies and synthetic databases to endorse the efficiency of
our approach. The algorithm presents a cubic worst-case runtime complexity in terms
of the number of nodes in the graph, which is an improvement over previous work.},

algorithms with relational query semantics integrated with graph databases is limited
because of low performance and high memory consumption of existing solutions. In this
work, we implement a matrix-based CFPQ algorithm by using appropriate high-performance
libraries for linear algebra and integrate it with RedisGraph graph database. Also,
we introduce a new CFPQ algorithm with single-path query semantics that allows us
to extract one found path for each pair of nodes. Finally, we provide the evaluation
of our algorithms for both semantics which shows that matrix-based CFPQ implementation
for Redis-Graph database is performant enough for real-world data analysis.},

abstract = {Recursive Descent (RD) parsers are popular because their control flow follows the structure of the grammar and hence they are easy to write and to debug. However, the class of grammars which admit RD parsers is very limited. Backtracking techniques may be used to extend this class, but can have explosive runtimes and cannot deal with grammars with left recursion. Tomita-style RNGLR parsers are fully general but are based on LR techniques and do not have the direct relationship with the grammar that an RD parser has. We develop the fully general GLL parsing technique which is recursive descent-like, and has the property that the parse follows closely the structure of the grammar rules, but uses RNGLR-like machinery to handle non-determinism. The resulting recognisers run in worst-case cubic time and can be built even for left recursive grammars.}

abstract="Many graph query languages use, at their core, path queries that yield node pairs that are connected by a path of interest. For the end-user, such node pairs only give limited insight as to why this query result is obtained, as the pair does not directly identify the underlying path of interest. To address this limitation of path queries, we propose the single-path semantics, which evaluates path queries to, for each node pair (m, n), a single path from m to n satisfying the conditions of the query. To put our proposal in practice, we provide an efficient algorithm for evaluating context-free path queries, a particular powerful type of path queries, using the single-path semantics. Additionally, we perform a short evaluation of our techniques that shows that the single-path semantics is practically feasible, even when query results grow large.",

Hence one goal of recent research has been to obtain analogous theorems for subclasses of the context-free languages.We establish here a property of LL(k) derivation trees which is analogous to the left part property for strict deterministic grammars[H&amp;H]. We show that our property characterizes LL(k) grammars and use it to establish two iteration theorems for the LL languages. These theorems, in turn, enable us to prove simply and rigorously that a variety of LR languages are not LL. In particular, the “dangling” Algol 60 IF-THEN-ELSE construct allowed in Pascal and PL/1 cannot be generated by an LL(k) grammar.},
