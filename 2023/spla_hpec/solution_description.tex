\section{Proposed Solution}

The proposed Spla library implemented using the C++17 language and  vendor-agnostic OpenCL 1.2 for GPU specific computations. The OpenCL is chosen over Cuda and SyCL technologies. While Cuda is specific only for Nvidia devices, SyCL is a promising API, but it is too high-level and its support is still controversial. The implementation of common operations and graph algorithms is based on papers~\cite{7284398:spvspm, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1804.03327:pushpull, yang2019graphblast} of Yang et al. It involves such optimizations as push-pull, masking, early exit, and sparse-dense storage switch. Also Spla features a number of nontrivial OpenCL-specific improvements, such as custom small memory allocation, kernel cache, and operations storage to reduce overall CPU-driver overhead.
