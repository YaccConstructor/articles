\begin{abstract}
The rational index of a context-free language  $L$ is a function $f(n)$, such that for each regular language $R$ recognized by an automaton with $n$ states, the intersection of $L$ and $R$ is either empty or contains a word shorter than $f(n)$. It is known that the context-free language (CFL-)reachability problem and Datalog query evaluation for context-free languages (queries) with the polynomial rational index is in NC, while these problems is P-complete in the general case. We investigate the rational index of bounded-oscillation languages and show that it is of polynomial order. We obtain upper bounds on the values of the rational index for general bounded-oscillation languages and for some of its previously studied subclasses.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The notion of a rational index was introduced by Boasson et al. \cite{RatBasic} as a complexity measure for context-free languages.  The rational index $\rho_L(n)$ is a function, which denotes the maximum length of the shortest word in $L \cap R$, for arbitrary $R$ recognized by an $n$-state automaton. The rational index plays an important role in determining the parallel complexity of such practical problems as the context-free language (CFL-)reachability problem and Datalog chain query evaluation.

The CFL-reachability problem for a fixed context-free grammar $G$ is stated as follows: given a directed edge-labeled graph $D$ and a pair of nodes  $u$ and $v$, determine whether there is a path from $u$ to $v$ labeled with a string in $L(G)$.  That is, CFL-reachability is a kind of graph reachability problem with path constraints given by context-free languages. It is an important problem underlying some fundamental static code analysis like data flow analysis and program slicing \cite{RepsBasic}, alias analysis \cite*{Chatterjee, alias}, points-to analysis \cite{Incremental} and other \cite{Cai, android, typeflow}, and graph database query evaluation \cite{Azimov, GrigorevRagozina, HellingsCFPQ, RDF}.  


The Datalog chain query evaluation on a database graph is equivalent to the CFL-reachability problem. 
\begin{example}[Datalog query as a context-free grammar]
\label{DatalogExample}
Consider a database  $D$ with relation ``$child$''. It also can be represented as a digraph $G$, where each node of the graph corresponds to a person, and edges are labeled with a word ``$child$''.


The following Datalog query determines all pairs of people $x$ and $y$ such that $x$ is a descendant of $y$: 


$Desc(x, y)$ :- $Child(x, y)$

$Desc(x, y)$ :- $Child(x, z), Desc(z, y)$


This query can be represented as a context-free grammar with the following rules: 


$Desc \rightarrow Child$ $\vert$ $Child$ $Desc$


$Child  \rightarrow child$


Thus, evaluating the above mentioned Datalog query over database $D$ is equivalent to solving the CFL-reachability problem for a context-free grammar representation of this query and the edge-labeled graph $G$.
\end{example}



Unlike context-free language recognition, which is in NC (when context-free grammar is fixed), the CFL-reachability problem is P-complete \cite{ PCompl, RepSeq,  Yannakakis}. Practically, it means that there is no efficient parallel algorithm for solving this problem (unless P $\neq$ NC). 


The question on the parallel complexity of Datalog chain queries was investigated independently \cite{ChainQ, Vardi, Ullman}. Ullman and Van Gelder \cite{Ullman} introduce the notion of a \textit{polynomial fringe property} and show that chain queries having this property is in NC. The polynomial fringe property is equivalent to having the polynomial rational index: for a context-free language $L(G)$ having the polynomial rational index $\rho_L(n) = poly(n)$, where $poly(n)$ is some polynomial, is the same as for corresponding query to have the polynomial fringe property. It has been shown that for every algebraic number $\gamma$, a language with the rational index in $\Theta (n^\gamma )$ exists \cite{GreibRat}.  In contrast, the rational index of languages, which generate all context-free languages (an example of such language is the Dyck language on two pairs of parentheses $D_2$) is in order $exp(\Theta(n^2/\ln n))$ \cite{CFRat}, and, hence, this is the upper bound on the value of the rational index for every context-free language.


While both problems is not parallelizable in general, it is useful to develop more efficient parallel solutions for specific subclasses of the context-free languages. For example, there are context-free languages which admit more efficient parallel algorithms in comparison with the general case of context-free recognition \cite{IBARRA2, IBARRA, Okhotin2014ComplexityOI}.  The same holds for the CFL-reachability problem: there are some examples of context-free languages, for which the CFL-reachability problem lies in NL complexity class (for example, linear and one-counter languages) \cite{labelledGraphs, LReach, Regularrealizability, VyalyiRR}. These languages have the polynomial rational index.


The family of linear languages (linear Datalog programs, respectively) is the well-known subclass of context-free languages having the polynomial rational index \cite{RatBasic, Ullman}. The value of its rational index is in $O(n^2)$ \cite{RatBasic}. Linear Datalog programs have been widely studied by deductive database community, because efficient evaluation methods and optimisation techniques exist for such programs \cite{linearisability, linopt, Ullman}. For instance, the Datalog program in Example~\ref{DatalogExample} is linear. Many efforts have been devoted to find larger subclasses of context-free languages (Datalog programs) having the polynomial rational indices \cite{ChainQ, linearisability, RatBasic, KanellakisParallel, Regularrealizability, Ullman, VyalyiRR}.  Two equivalent classes generalizing linear languages were proposed: piecewise linear programs \cite{KanellakisParallel, Ullman} and the family of quasi-rational languages (the substitution closure of the family of linear languages) \cite{RatBasic}; both were independently shown to have the polynomial rational index. Quasi-rational languages are generated by \textit{nonexpansive} grammars. A variable $S$ in a context-free grammar $G$ is expansive if there exists a derivation $S  \stackrel {*}{\Rightarrow } uSvSw$ for some words $u, v, w$. A grammar which contains no expansive variable is said to be nonexpansive. However, it was shown by Afrati et al. that piecewise linear programs is equivalent to linear programs \cite{linearisability}. Therefore, the generalization of linear languages preserving polynomiality of the rational index is remain to be found.


In this work we investigate the rational index of  bounded-oscilation languages. Bounded-oscillation languages were introduced by Ganty and Valput \cite{BoundOsc}. Just like linear languages, it is defined by restriction on the pushdown automata. This restriction is based on the notion of \textit{oscillation}, a special measure of how the stack height varies over time. This class generalizes a fimily of linear languages.


\textbf{Our contributions.} Our results can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We show that the rational index of bounded-oscillation languages of Ganty and Valput \cite{BoundOsc} is polynomial and give an upper bound on its value in dependence of the value of oscillation.
\item We give upper bounds on the value of rational indices of previously studied subclasses of bounded-oscillation languages: superlinear and ultralinear languages.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions and open problems}
\label{sec:conc}

We have proved that the bounded-oscillation languages have the polynomial rational index. It means that the CFL-reachability problem and Datalog query evalution for these languages is in NC. This class is a natural generalization of linear languages, and possibly it comprises the largest previously known class of queries which is NC. It is interesting whether Datalog programs corresponding to these languages are linearizable (can always be transformed into linear Datalog programs).


There is a family of languages which has the polynomial rational index, but is not comparable with the linear languages: the family of one-counter languages. Moreover, it is not comparable with bounded-oscillation languages: for example, the Dyck language $D_1$ which is one-counter language, is not $k$-bounded-oscillation language for any $k$. Can this class be generalized in the same manner as linear languages with respect to the polynomiality of the rational index? One can consider the Polynomial Stack Lemma defined by Afrati et al. \cite{ChainQ}, where some restriction on the PDA stack contents are given, or investigate the properties of the family of the substitution closure of one-counter languages, which contains one-counter languages and has the polynomial rational index \cite{RatBasic}.
