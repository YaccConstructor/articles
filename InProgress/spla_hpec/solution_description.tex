\section{Proposed Solution}

The proposed Spla library implemented in C++17 language, using vendor-agnostic OpenCL 1.2 for GPU specific computations. The OpenCL is chosen over Cuda and SyCL technologies. While Cuda is specific only for Nvidia devices, SyCL is a promising API, but it is too high-level and its support is still debatable. The implementation of linear algebra operations is based on Yang et al.~\cite{7284398:spvspm, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1804.03327:pushpull, yang2019graphblast} works. Common graph algorithms, such as BFS, SSSP, PR and TC implemented with respect to GraphBLAST. Spla features a number of optimizations, such as push-pull, masking, early exit, custom small memory allocation, and sparse-dense storage switch.
