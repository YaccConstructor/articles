\section{Conclusion}

We presented Spla, the generalized sparse linear algebra library with vendor-agnostic GPUs accelerated computations. The evaluation of the proposed solution for some real-world graphs on four different algorithms shows, that the OpenCL-based solution demonstrates competitive performance and has acceptable scalability on devices of different GPUs vendors. There is still a plenty of research questions and directions for improvement, such as further workload balance, performance tuning, graph streaming~\cite{10.1145/2600212.2600227} and multi-GPU support~\cite{7967137}.
