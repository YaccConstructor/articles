\section{Conclusion}

We presented Spla, generalized sparse linear algebra library with vendor-agnostic GPUs accelerated computations. The evaluation of the proposed solutions for some real-world graph data in four different algorithms shows, that OpenCL-based solution has a promising performance, comparable to analogs, has acceptable scalability on devices of different GPU vendors. There is still a plenty of research questions and directions for improvement, such as further workload balance, performance tuning~\cite{8025284/spgemm/nagasaka}, graph streaming~\cite{10.1145/2600212.2600227} and multi-GPU support~\cite{7967137}.
