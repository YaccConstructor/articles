Scalable high-performance graph analysis is an actual challenge.
CuSha~\cite{10.1145/2600212.2600227}, Gunrock~\cite{7967137} show that utilization of GPUs can improve the performance of graph analysis. But low flexibility and high complexity of API are problems of these solutions. The promising thing which provides a user-friendly API is a linear algebra based model, formalized in GraphBLAS~\cite{7761646}. While reference CPU-based implementation of this API, SuiteSparse~\cite{10.1145/3322125}, demonstrates good performance in real-world tasks, GPU-based implementation is challenging due to required operations generalization, data sparsity, and hardware programming complexity. Such well-known libraries as cuSPARSE, clSPARSE, bhSPARSE, CUSP cannot be reused, since they are almost all specified for operations over floats. GraphBLAST~\cite{yang2019graphblast}, GBTL~\cite{7529957} show promising GPU performance of GraphBLAS-based graph analysis solutions. But these solutions are not portable because they are based on Nvidia Cuda. In order to address this problem we developed the GraphBLAS-inspired \textit{Spla} library\footnote{Source code of Spla library available at: \url{https://github.com/SparseLinearAlgebra/spla}}, which features portable OpenCL-based acceleration and shows performance comparable with GraphBLAST, achieving up to 36 times speedup in some cases.
