abstract = {Formal languages are widely studied, taught and used in computer science. However, only a small part of this domain is brought to a broader audience, and students often have no practical experience in their curriculum. In this tool paper, we introduce Pyformlang, a practical and pedagogical Python library for formal languages. Our library implements the most common algorithms of the domain, accessible by an easy-to-use interface. The code is written exclusively in Python3, with a clear structure, so as to allow students to play and learn with it.},

abstract="We survey some foundational results on querying graph-structured data. We focus on general-purpose navigational query languages, such as regular path queries and its extensions with conjunctions, inverses, and path comparisons. We study complexity, expressive power, and static analysis. The course material should be useful to anyone with an interest in query languages for graph structured data, and more broadly in foundational aspects of database theory.",

abstract = {Recently proposed matrix multiplication based algorithm for context-free path querying (CFPQ) offloads the most performance-critical parts onto boolean matrices multiplication. Thus, it is possible to achieve high performance of CFPQ by means of modern parallel hardware and software. In this paper, we provide results of empirical performance comparison of different implementations of this algorithm on both real-world data and synthetic data for the worst cases.},
