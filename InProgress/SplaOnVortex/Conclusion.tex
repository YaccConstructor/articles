\section{Conclusion}

In this work we evaluated Spla---linear algebra based graph analysis library---on RISC-V IAS based GPGPU Vortex.
We show that Spla is portable enough to be run on Vortex. Vortex ready to run. Scaling. 

Future work. Floats. More experiments in SimX. On different graphs. On other algorithms. Limits of scaling with clusters.
FPGA resources. Performance on FPGA.

Evaluate Ventus~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/THU-DSP-LAB/ventus-gpgpu}}~\cite{VentusICCD2024} GPU, compare with Vortex. !!!
