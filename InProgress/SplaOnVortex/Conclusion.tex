\section{Conclusion}

In this work we evaluated Spla---linear algebra based graph analysis library---on RISC-V IAS based GPGPU Vortex.
We show that Spla is portable enough to be run on Vortex. Vortex ready to run. Scaling. 

Future work

Evaluate Ventus~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/THU-DSP-LAB/ventus-gpgpu}}~\cite{VentusICCD2024} GPU, compare with Vortex. !!!
