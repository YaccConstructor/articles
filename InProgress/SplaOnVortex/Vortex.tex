\section{RISC-V GPGPU Vortex}

Vortex\footnote{\url{https://github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex}}~\cite{10.1145/3466752.3480128} is an open-source RISC-V ISA based GPGPU.
For programming it supports OpenCL via POCL\footnote{!!!}~\cite{!!!} compiler. 
Moreover, it designed for FPGA equipped with high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that can !!! for graph processing

Configurable. Architecture (figure), Cluster, core, threads, warp. Caches.

Simulators SimX, RTL, FPGA 
SimX is faster than RTL simulation.

While A extension is declared, atomics supported only in SimX, not in RTL.
