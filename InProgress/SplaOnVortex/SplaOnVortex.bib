abstract = {The importance of open-source hardware and software has been increasing. However, despite GPUs being one of the more popular accelerators across various applications, there is very little open-source GPU infrastructure in the public domain. We argue that one of the reasons for the lack of open-source infrastructure for GPUs is rooted in the complexity of their ISA and software stacks. In this work, we first propose an ISA extension to RISC-V that supports GPGPUs and graphics. The main goal of the ISA extension proposal is to minimize the ISA changes so that the corresponding changes to the open-source ecosystem are also minimal, which makes for a sustainable development ecosystem. To demonstrate the feasibility of the minimally extended RISC-V ISA, we implemented the complete software and hardware stacks of Vortex on FPGA. Vortex is a PCIe-based soft GPU that supports OpenCL and OpenGL. Vortex can be used in a variety of applications, including machine learning, graph analytics, and graphics rendering. Vortex can scale up to 32 cores on an Altera Stratix 10 FPGA, delivering a peak performance of 25.6 GFlops at 200 Mhz.},

abstract = {High-performance implementations of graph algorithms are challenging to implement on new parallel hardware such as GPUs because of three challenges: (1)&nbsp;the difficulty of coming up with graph building blocks, (2)&nbsp;load imbalance on parallel hardware, and (3)&nbsp;graph problems having low arithmetic intensity. To address some of these challenges, GraphBLAS is an innovative, on-going effort by the graph analytics community to propose building blocks based on sparse linear algebra, which allow graph algorithms to be expressed in a performant, succinct, composable, and portable manner. In this paper, we examine the performance challenges of a linear-algebra-based approach to building graph frameworks and describe new design principles for overcoming these bottlenecks. Among the new design principles is exploiting input sparsity, which allows users to write graph algorithms without specifying push and pull direction. Exploiting output sparsity allows users to tell the backend which values of the output in a single vectorized computation they do not want computed. Load-balancing is an important feature for balancing work amongst parallel workers. We describe the important load-balancing features for handling graphs with different characteristics. The design principles described in this paper have been implemented in “GraphBLAST”, the first high-performance linear algebra-based graph framework on NVIDIA GPUs that is open-source. The results show that on a single GPU, GraphBLAST has on average at least an order of magnitude speedup over previous GraphBLAS implementations SuiteSparse and GBTL, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives and shared-memory graph frameworks Ligra and Gunrock, and better performance than any other GPU graph framework, while offering a simpler and more concise programming model.},

abstract = {SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is a full parallel implementation of the GraphBLAS standard, which defines a set of sparse matrix operations on an extended algebra of semirings using an almost unlimited variety of operators and types. When applied to sparse adjacency matrices, these algebraic operations are equivalent to computations on graphs. A description of the parallel implementation of SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is given, including its novel parallel algorithms for sparse matrix multiply, addition, element-wise multiply, submatrix extraction and assignment, and the GraphBLAS mask/accumulator operation. Its performance is illustrated by solving the graph problems in the GAP Benchmark and by comparing it with other sparse matrix libraries.},
