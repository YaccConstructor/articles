\section{Spla Graph Analysis Library}

Spla~\cite{spla} is a GPGPU‑accelerated, GraphBLAS‑inspired library for graph analysis.
It is based on sparse linear algebra and uses OpenCL to offload linear algebra kernels to appropriate devices, including GPGPUs.
Using OpenCL makes the library vendor-agnostic: it has been shown in~\cite{spla} that Spla performs and scales well across GPUs from different vendors including AMD, Intel, and Nvida.

The library implements several classical graph analysis algorithms, including canonical single-source level BFS, triangle counting (TC), single-source shortest path (SSSP), and PageRank.
