Spla\footnote{Spla sources on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/SparseLinearAlgebra/spla}}~\cite{!!!} is a GPGPU-powered GraphBLAS-inspired library for graph analysis.
It is based on sparse linear algebra and uses OpenCL to offload linear algebra related kernels to appropriate devices, including GPGPUs.
Utilization of OpenCL make this library vendor-agnostic.

Such graph analysis algorithms as canonical single-source level BFS, !!!Sandia!!! triangle counting (TC), single-source shortest path (SSSP), PageRank are implemented as part of library. 

In~\cite{!!!} it was shown that it performes and scales well across GPUs of different vendors.
What about Vortex?
