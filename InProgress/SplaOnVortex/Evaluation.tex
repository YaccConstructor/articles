\section{Evaluation}

The goal of this evaluation is to assess the performance scaling of Spla on Vortex.
Due to limitations in atomic operation support within the RTL implementation, all experiments were performed using the SimX functional simulator.

\subsection{Environment}

Initial testing revealed issues with floating-point operations, which produced incorrect results for some hardware configurations.
Consequently, we limited subsequent experiments to Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Triangle Counting (TC), excluding Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) and PageRank.
To keep simulation times manageable, we used a single graph from the SuiteSparse matrix collection\footnote{A diverse collection of sparse matrices from various domains: \url{http://sparse.tamu.edu/}}: soc-Epinions1, with 75~888 vertices and 508~837 edges.


We conducted two series of experiments.
The first varies the number of warps and threads per warp while keeping the number of clusters and cores fixed (at 2 and 4, respectively), with the goal of selecting the best core configuration while preserving multi-core execution to account for cache effects.
The second series, using the best configuration identified in the first step, varies the number of clusters and cores per cluster to assess scaling at the core and cluster levels.
