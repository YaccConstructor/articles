  abstract="Many computing applications require processing of data that are directly collected from the Internet. In this context, the use of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) has became a common feature. The query and analysis of RDF data is paramount to explore the full potential of the data available on the Web. Query languages for RDF graph databases rely on the use of regular expressions to identify paths over the data. Some interesting queries, such as same-generation queries, cannot be expressed by regular expressions. We are interested in extending the expressiveness of queries over graph databases by using paths defined by context-free grammars. We introduce a new query algorithm to process context-free path queries over graph databases. Our approach is inspired by the LR(1) parsing techniques. A prototype was implemented and experiments were conducted to validate and compare the results of our algorithm with those obtained by similar approaches.",

 abstract="Recursive state machines (RSMs) enhance the power of ordinary state machines by allowing vertices to correspond 
 either to ordinary states or to potentially recursive invocations of other state machines. RSMs can model the control 
 flow in sequential imperative programs containing recursive procedure calls. They can be viewed as a visual notation 
 extending Statecharts-like hierarchical state machines, where concurrency is disallowed but recursion is allowed. 
 They are also related to various models of pushdown systems studied in the verification and program analysis communities.",

abstract="The original SPARQL proposal was often criticized for its inability to navigate through the structure of RDF documents. For this reason property paths were introduced in SPARQL 1.1, but up to date there are no theoretical studies examining how their addition to the language affects main computational tasks such as query evaluation, query containment, and query subsumption. In this paper we tackle all of these problems and show that although the addition of property paths has no impact on query evaluation, they do make the containment and subsumption problems substantially more difficult.",

abstract="We present a technique for syntax analysis of a regular set of input strings. This problem is relevant for the analysis of string-embedded languages when a host program generates clauses of embedded language at run time. Our technique is based on a generalization of RNGLR algorithm, which, inherently, allows us to construct a finite representation of parse forest for regularly approximated set of input strings. This representation can be further utilized for semantic analysis and transformations in the context of reengineering, code maintenance, program understanding etc. The approach in question implements relaxed parsing: non-recognized strings in approximation set are ignored with no error detection.",

RPQs are, often in restricted forms, part of graph-oriented query languages such as XQuery/XPath and SPARQL, and have applications in areas such as semantic, social, and biomedical networks. However, existing systems for evaluating RPQs are restricted either in the type of the graph (e.g., only trees), the type of regular expressions (e.g., only single steps), and/or the size of the graphs they can handle. No method has yet been developed that would be capable of efficiently evaluating general RPQs on large graphs, i.e., with millions of nodes/edges.",
