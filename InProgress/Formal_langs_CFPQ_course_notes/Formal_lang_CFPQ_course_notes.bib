abstract = "We present a method based on top-down parsing techniques for evaluating context-free path queries on RDF Graph Databases. The syntax of the query language is based on SPARQL. The language extends SPARQL by allowing the use of non-terminal symbols of a context-free grammar to specify paths on the graph. In this manner, the language subsumes the definition of regular graph patterns present in SPARQL. Our query evaluator takes an RDF graph, a context-free grammar and a declarative query, and produces tuples of values. The query evaluator proceeds in two stages: Firstly, the RDF graph is enriched with edges representing paths which correspond to strings derived by the grammar. We show that this algorithm is correct and presents a cubic worst-case run-time complexity on the number of nodes in the graph, which is an improvement over some previous work. The second stage of the evaluator uses the produced graph to identify tuples of values defined by a declarative query. In order to validate our approach, we conducted experiments by using some popular ontologies as well as synthetic databases. We compare performance results of our method with some related work."

abstract="We present a technique for syntax analysis of a regular set of input strings. This problem is relevant for the analysis of string-embedded languages when a host program generates clauses of embedded language at run time. Our technique is based on a generalization of RNGLR algorithm, which, inherently, allows us to construct a finite representation of parse forest for regularly approximated set of input strings. This representation can be further utilized for semantic analysis and transformations in the context of reengineering, code maintenance, program understanding etc. The approach in question implements relaxed parsing: non-recognized strings in approximation set are ignored with no error detection.",

title = "Conjunctive and boolean grammars: The true general case of the context-free grammars",
abstract = "Conjunctive grammars extend the definition of a context-free grammar by allowing a conjunction operation in the rules; Boolean grammars are further equipped with an explicit negation. These grammars maintain the main principle of the context-free grammars, that of defining syntactically correct strings inductively from their substrings, but lift the restriction of using disjunction only. This paper surveys the results on conjunctive and Boolean grammars obtained over the last decade, comparing them to the corresponding results for ordinary context-free grammars and their main subfamilies. Much attention is given to parsing algorithms, most of which are inherited from the case of ordinary context-free grammars without increasing their computational complexity. The intended readership includes any computer scientists looking for a compact and accessible description of this formal model and its properties, as well as for a general outlook on formal grammars. The paper is also addressed to theoretical computer scientists seeking a subject for research; an account of pure theoretical research in the area presented in this paper is accompanied by a list of significant open problems, with an award offered for the first correct solution of each problem. Several directions for future investigation are proposed.",

abstract="Navigational graph queries are an important class of queries that can extract implicit binary relations over the nodes of input graphs. Most of the navigational query languages used in the RDF community, e.g. property paths in W3C SPARQL 1.1 and nested regular expressions in nSPARQL, are based on the regular expressions. It is known that regular expressions have limited expressivity; for instance, some natural queries, like same generation-queries, are not expressible with regular expressions. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present cfSPARQL, an extension of SPARQL query language equipped with context-free grammars. The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than property paths and nested expressions. The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph similarities, graph summarization and ontology alignment. Despite the increasing expressivity, we show that cfSPARQL still enjoys a low computational complexity and can be evaluated efficiently.",

	abstract = "Multiple context-free grammars (mcfg's) is a subclass of generalized context-free grammars introduced by Pollard (1984) in order to describe the syntax of natural languages. The class of languages generated by mcfg's (called multiple context-free languages or, shortly, mcfl's) properly includes the class of context-free languages and is properly included in the class of context-sensitive languages. First, the paper presents results on the generative capacity of mcfg's and also on the properties of mcfl's such as formal language-theoretic closure properties. Next, it is shown that the time complexity of the membership problem for multiple context-free languages is O(ne), where n is the length of an input string and e is a constant called the degree of a given mcfg. Head grammars (hg's) introduced by Pollard and tree adjoining grammars (tag's) introduced by Joshi et al. (1975) are also grammatical formalisms to describe the syntax of natural languages. The paper also presents the following results on the generative capacities of hg's, tag's and 2-mcfg's, which are a subclass of mcfg's: (1) The class HL of languages generated by hg's is the same as the one generated by tag's; (2) HL is the same as the one generated by left-wrapping hg's (or right-wrapping hg's) which is a proper subclass of hg's; (3) HL is properly included in the one generated by 2-mcfg's. As a corollary of (1), it is also shown that HL is a substitution-closed full AFL."
