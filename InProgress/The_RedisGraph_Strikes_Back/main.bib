abstract="Navigational graph queries are an important class of queries that can extract implicit binary relations over the nodes of input graphs. Most of the navigational query languages used in the RDF community, e.g. property paths in W3C SPARQL 1.1 and nested regular expressions in nSPARQL, are based on the regular expressions. It is known that regular expressions have limited expressivity; for instance, some natural queries, like same generation-queries, are not expressible with regular expressions. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present cfSPARQL, an extension of SPARQL query language equipped with context-free grammars. The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than property paths and nested expressions. The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph similarities, graph summarization and ontology alignment. Despite the increasing expressivity, we show that cfSPARQL still enjoys a low computational complexity and can be evaluated efficiently.",

abstract="Context-free path queries (CFPQ) extend the regular path queries (RPQ) by allowing context-free grammars to be used as constraints for paths. Algorithms for CFPQ are actively developed, but J. Kuijpers et al. have recently concluded, that existing algorithms are not performant enough to be used in real-world applications. Thus the development of new algorithms for CFPQ is justified. In this paper, we provide a new CFPQ algorithm which is based on such linear algebra operations as Kronecker product and transitive closure and handles grammars presented as recursive state machines. Thus, the proposed algorithm can be implemented by using high-performance libraries and modern parallel hardware. Moreover, it avoids grammar growth which provides the possibility for queries optimization.",

abstract = {Existing RDF engines follow one of two design paradigms: relational or graph-based. Such engines are typically designed for specific hardware architectures, mainly CPUs, and are not easily portable to new architectures. Porting an existing engine to a different architecture (e.g., many-core architectures) entails almost redesign from scratch. We explore sparse matrix algebra as a third paradigm for designing a portable, scalable, and efficient RDF engine. We demonstrate MAGiQ; a matrix algebra approach for evaluating complex SPARQL queries over large RDF datasets. MAGiQ represents an RDF graph as a sparse matrix, and translates SPARQL queries to matrix algebra programs. MAGiQ takes advantage of the existing rich software infrastructure for processing sparse matrices, optimized for many architectures (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, distributed), effortlessly. This demo motivates the adoption of matrix algebra in RDF graph processing by showing MAGiQ's performance with different matrix algebra backend engines. MAGiQ, using a GPU, is orders of magnitude faster in solving complex queries on a billion edge graph than state-of-the-art RDF systems.},

abstract="We are witnessing the evolution of the Web from a worldwide information space of linked documents to a global knowledge base, composed of semantically interconnected resources (to date, 25 billion RDF triples, interlinked by around 395 million RDF links). RDF comes equipped with the SPARQL language for querying data in RDF format. Although many aspects of the challenges faced in large-scale RDF data management have already been studied in the database research community, current approaches provide centralized hard-coded solutions, with high consumption of resources; moreover, these exhibit very limited flexibility dealing with queries, at various levels of granularity and complexity (e.g. so-called non-conjunctive queries that use SPARQL's union or optional). In this paper we propose a general model for answering SPARQL queries based on the first principles of linear algebra, in particular on tensorial calculus. Leveraging our abstract algebraic framework, our technique allows both quick decentralized processing, and centralized massive analysis. Experimental results show that our approach, utilizing recent linear algebra techniques---tailored to performance and accuracy as required in applied mathematics and physics fields---can process analysis efficiently, when compared to competitors.",

We explore sparse matrix algebra as a third paradigm and propose MAGiQ: a framework for implementing SPARQL query engines that are portable on various hardware architectures, scalable over thousands of compute nodes, and efficient for very large RDF datasets. MAGiQ represents the RDF graph as a sparse matrix and defines a domain-specific language of algebraic operations. SPARQL queries are translated into matrix algebra programs that are oblivious to the underlying computing infrastructure. Existing matrix algebra libraries, optimized for each particular architecture, are called to execute the program and handle the performance issues. We present three case studies of matrix algebra back-end libraries: SuiteSparse, MATLAB, and CombBLAS; we demonstrate how MAGiQ can effortlessly be ported on a variety of architectures such as Intel CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, and Cray XC40 supercomputers. Our experiments on large-scale real and synthetic datasets show that MAGiQ performs comparably to or better than existing specialized SPARQL query engines for data-intensive queries, scales to very large computing infrastructures, and handles datasets with up to 512 billion triples.},
