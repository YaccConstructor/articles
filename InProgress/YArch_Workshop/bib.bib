abstract = {Graphs are among the most important abstract data types in computer science, and the algorithms that operate on them are critical to modern life. Graphs have been shown to be powerful tools for modeling complex problems because of their simplicity and generality. Graph algorithms are one of the pillars of mathematics, informing research in such diverse areas as combinatorial optimization, complexity theory, and topology. Algorithms on graphs are applied in many ways in today s world - from Web rankings to metabolic networks, from finite element meshes to semantic graphs. The current exponential growth in graph data has forced a shift to parallel computing for executing graph algorithms. Implementing parallel graph algorithms and achieving good parallel performance have proven difficult. This book addresses these challenges by exploiting the well-known duality between a canonical representation of graphs as abstract collections of vertices and edges and a sparse adjacency matrix representation. This linear algebraic approach is widely accessible to scientists and engineers who may not be formally trained in computer science. The authors show how to leverage existing parallel matrix computation techniques and the large amount of software infrastructure that exists for these computations to implement efficient and scalable parallel graph algorithms. The benefits of this approach are reduced algorithmic complexity, ease of implementation, and improved performance. Graph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra is the first book to cover graph algorithms accessible to engineers and scientists not trained in computer science but having a strong linear algebra background, enabling them to quickly understand and apply graph algorithms. It also covers array-based graph algorithms, showing readers how to express canonical graph algorithms using a highly elegant and efficient array notation and how to tap into the large range of tools and techniques that have been built for matrices and tensors; parallel array-based algorithms, demonstrating with examples how to easily implement parallel graph algorithms using array-based approaches, which enables readers to address much larger graph problems; and array-based theory for analyzing graphs, providing a template for using array-based constructs to develop new theoretical approaches for graph analysis. Audience: This book is suitable as the primary text for a class on linear algebraic graph algorithms and as either the primary or supplemental text for a class on graph algorithms for engineers and scientists without training in computer science.

abstract = { Futhark is a purely functional data-parallel array language that offers a machine-neutral programming model and an optimising compiler that generates OpenCL code for GPUs.  This paper presents the design and implementation of three key features of Futhark that seek a suitable middle ground with imperative approaches.  First, in order to express efficient code inside the parallel constructs, we introduce a simple type system for in-place updates that ensures referential transparency and supports equational reasoning.  Second, we furnish Futhark with parallel operators capable of expressing efficient strength-reduced code, along with their fusion rules.  Third, we present a flattening transformation aimed at enhancing the degree of parallelism that (i) builds on loop interchange and distribution but uses higher-order reasoning rather than array-dependence analysis, and (ii) still allows further locality-of-reference optimisations. Finally, an evaluation on 16 benchmarks demonstrates the impact of the language and compiler features and shows application-level performance competitive with hand-written GPU code. },

abstract = {As the computational power of GPUs continues to scale with Moore's Law, an increasing number of applications are becoming limited by memory bandwidth. We propose an approach for programming GPUs with tightly-coupled specialized DMA warps for performing memory transfers between on-chip and off-chip memories. Separate DMA warps improve memory bandwidth utilization by better exploiting available memory-level parallelism and by leveraging efficient inter-warp producer-consumer synchronization mechanisms. DMA warps also improve programmer productivity by decoupling the need for thread array shapes to match data layout. To illustrate the benefits of this approach, we present an extensible API, CudaDMA, that encapsulates synchronization and common sequential and strided data transfer patterns. Using CudaDMA, we demonstrate speedup of up to 1.37x on representative synthetic microbenchmarks, and 1.15x-3.2x on several kernels from scientific applications written in CUDA running on NVIDIA Fermi GPUs.},

abstract = {We describe the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications. The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments: robust because performance results with artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB™, Mathematica™, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task.},

abstract = {While systolic arrays are widely used for dense-matrix operations, they are seldom used for sparse-matrix operations. In this paper, we show how a systolic array of Multiply-and-Accumulate (MAC) units, similar to Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), can be adapted to efficiently handle sparse matrices. TPU-like accelerators are built upon a 2D array of MAC units and have demonstrated high throughput and efficiency for dense matrix multiplication, which is a key kernel in machine learning algorithms and is the target of the TPU. In this work, we employ a co-designed approach of first developing a packing technique to condense a sparse matrix and then propose a systolic array based system, Sparse-TPU, abbreviated to STPU, to accommodate the matrix computations for the packed denser matrix counterparts. To demonstrate the efficacy of our co-designed approach, we evaluate sparse matrix-vector multiplication on a broad set of synthetic and real-world sparse matrices. Experimental results show that STPU delivers 16.08X higher performance while consuming 4.39X and 19.79X lower energy for integer (int8) and floating point (float32) implementations, respectively, over a TPU baseline. Meanwhile, STPU has 12.93% area overhead and an average of 4.14% increase in dynamic energy over the TPU baseline for the float32 implementation.},
