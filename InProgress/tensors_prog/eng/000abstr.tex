The Kronecker product-based algorithm for context-free path querying (CFPQ) was proposed by \cite{10.1007/978-3-030-54832-2_6}. We reduce this algorithm to operations over Boolean matrices and extend it with the mechanism to extract all paths of interest. We also prove $O(n^3/\log{n})$ time complexity of the proposed algorithm, where $n$ is a number of vertices of the input graph. Thus, we provide the alternative way to construct a slightly subcubic algorithm for CFPQ which is based on linear algebra and incremental transitive closure (a classic graph-theoretic problem), as opposed to the algorithm with the same complexity proposed by~\cite{10.1145/1328438.1328460}. Our evaluation shows that our algorithm is a good candidate to be the universal algorithm for both regular and context-free path querying.
