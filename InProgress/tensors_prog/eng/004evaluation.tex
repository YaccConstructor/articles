The goal of this evaluation is to investigate the applicability of the proposed algorithm to both regular and context-free path querying.
We measured the execution time of the index creation which solves the reachability problem for both kinds of queries.
The execution time for CFPQ was compared with Azimov's algorithm for CFPQ reachability.
We also investigated the practical applicability of the paths extraction algorithm to both regular and context-free path queries.

For evaluation, we used a PC with Ubuntu 18.04 installed.
It has Intel core i7-6700 CPU, 3.4GHz, and DDR4 64Gb RAM.
We only measure the execution time of the algorithms themselves, thus we assume an input graph is loaded into RAM in the form of its adjacency matrix in the sparse format.
Note, that the time needed to load an input graph into the RAM is excluded from the time measurements.

\subsection{RPQ Evaluation}

To investigate the applicability of the proposed algorithm for regular path querying we gathered a dataset that consists of both real-world and synthetically generated graphs.
We generated the queries from the most popular RPQ templates.

\subsubsection{Dataset}

We gathered several graphs that represent real-world data from different areas and are frequently used for the evaluation of the graph querying algorithms.
Namely, the dataset consists of three parts.
The first part is the set of LUBM graphs\footnote{Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM) web page: \url{http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/}. Access date: 07.07.2020.}~\cite{10.1016/j.websem.2005.06.005} which have different numbers of vertices.
The second one is the set of graphs from Uniprot database\footnote{Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) web page: \url{https://www.uniprot.org/}. All files used can be downloaded via the link: \url{ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/rdf/}. Access date: 07.07.2020.}: \textit{proteomes}, \textit{taxonomy} and \textit{uniprotkb}.
The~last part consists of the RDF files \textit{mappingbased\_properties} from DBpedia\footnote{DBpedia project web site: \url{https://wiki.dbpedia.org/}. Access date: 07.07.2020.} and \textit{geospecies}\footnote{The Geospecies RDF: \url{https://old.datahub.io/dataset/geospecies}. Access date: 07.07.2020.}.
A brief description of the graphs in the dataset is presented in Table~\ref{tbl:graphs_for_rpq}.

Queries for evaluation were generated from the templates for the most popular RPQs, specifically, the queries presented in Table 2 in~\cite{Pacaci2020RegularPQ} and in Table 5 in~\cite{Wang2019}.
These query templates are presented in Table~\ref{tbl:queries_templates}.
We generate 10 queries for each template and each graph.
The most frequent relations from the given graph were used as symbols in the query template\footnote{Used generator is available as part of CFPQ\_data project: \url{https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/CFPQ_Data/blob/master/tools/gen_RPQ/gen.py}. Access data: 07.07.2020.}.
We used the same set of queries for all LUBM graphs to investigate the scalability of the proposed algorithm.

\subsubsection{Results}

We averaged the execution time of index creation over 5 runs for each query.
Index creation time for LUBM graphs set is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:lubm_all_qs}.
We can see that evaluation time depends on the query: there are queries evaluated in less than 1 second even for the largest graphs ($Q_2$, $Q_5$, $Q_{11}^2$, $Q_{11}^3$), while the worst time is 6.26 seconds ($Q_{14}$).
The execution time of our algorithm is comparable with the recent results for the same graphs and queries implemented on a distributed system over 10 nodes~\cite{Wang2019}, while we use only one node.
We conclude that our algorithm demonstrates reasonable performance to be applied to the real-world data analysis.
%\cho{Note that the accurate comparison of different approaches may be a promising direction of future research.}

   \label{fig:lubm_all_qs}
\end{figure}

Index creation time for each query on the real-world graphs is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:other_all_qs}.
We can see that querying small graphs requires more time than querying bigger graphs in some cases.
For example, consider $Q_{10}^4$: querying the \textit{geospecies} graph (450k vertices) in some cases requires more time than querying of \textit{mappingbased\_properties} (8.3M vertices) and \textit{taxonomy} (5.7M vertices).
We conclude that the evaluation time depends on the inner structure of a graph.
On the other hand, \textit{taxonomy} querying in many cases requires significantly more time than for other graphs, while \textit{taxonomy} is not the biggest graph.
Finally, in most cases, query execution lasts less than 10 seconds, even for bigger graphs, and no query requires more than 52.17 seconds.

%We evaluate path extraction for queries which result in possibly long paths.
%Long paths usually require many iterations of transitive closure evaluation, thus we used the number of the iterations as a criterion to select the inputs for the evaluation.
%For each selected graph and query we measure paths extraction time for each reachable pair.
%Since the index can be reused from the previous step, we omit the time necessary to create the index.
%We limit by 10 the number of paths to extract.

%In Figures~\ref{fig:geo_tensors_rpq} and~\ref{fig:dbpedia_tensors_rpq} we show the time needed to extract a path of a specific length when only one path was extracted.
%The main observation is that time is linear on the path length, even if a generic path extraction procedure is used.

\subsection{CFPQ Evaluation}

We evaluate the applicability of the proposed algorithm to CFPQ processing over real-world graphs on a number of classic cases and compare them with Azimov's algorithm.
Currently, only a single path version of Azimov's algorithm exists, and we use its implementation using PyGraphBLAS. Note that it is not trivial to compare our results with the state-of-the-art results provided by~\cite{10.1145/3398682.3399163} (Azimov's algorithm) because our algorithm computes significantly more information. While the state-of-the-art solution computes only reachability facts or a single-path semantics, our algorithm computes data necessary to restore all possible paths.

\subsubsection{Dataset}

We use CFPQ\_Data\footnote{CFPQ\_Data is a dataset for CFPQ evaluation which contains both synthetic and real-world data and queries \url{https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/CFPQ\_Data}. Access date: 07.07.2020.} dataset for evaluation.
Namely, we use relatively big RDF files and respective same-generation queries $G_1$~(Eq.~\ref{eqn:g_1}) and $G_2$~(Eq.~\ref{eqn:g_2}) which are used in other works for CFPQ evaluation.
We also use the $Geo$~(Eq.~\ref{eqn:geo}) query provided by~\cite{Kuijpers:2019:ESC:3335783.3335791} for \textit{geospecies} RDF.
Note that we use $\overline{x}$ notation in queries to denote the inverse of $x$ relation and the respective edge.
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\label{eqn:g_1}
S \to & \overline{\textit{subClassOf}} \ \ S \ \textit{subClasOf} \mid \overline{\textit{type}} \ \ S \ \textit{type}\\   & \mid \overline{\textit{subClassOf}} \ \ \textit{subClasOf} \mid \overline{\textit{type}} \ \textit{type}
\end{split}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\label{eqn:g_2}
S \to \overline{\textit{subClassOf}} \ \ S \ \textit{subClasOf} \mid \textit{subClassOf}
\end{split}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\label{eqn:geo}
S \to & \textit{broaderTransitive} \ \  S \ \overline{\textit{broaderTransitive}} \\
      & \mid \textit{broaderTransitive} \ \  \overline{\textit{broaderTransitive}}
\end{split}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\label{eqn:ma}
S & \to \overline{d} \ V \ d \\
V & \to ((S?) \overline{a})^* (S?) (a (S?))^*
\end{split}
\end{align}

Additionally, we evaluate our algorithm on memory aliases analysis problem: a well-known problem which can be reduced to CFPQ~\cite{Zheng:2008:DAA:1328897.1328464}.
To do it, we use some graphs built for different parts of Linux OS kernel (\textit{arch}, \textit{crypto}, \textit{drivers}, \textit{fs}) and the query \textit{MA}~(Eq.~\ref{eqn:ma})~\cite{10.1145/3093336.3037744}.
The detailed data about all the graphs used is presented in Table~\ref{tbl:graphs_for_cfpq}.

}

We can see that while in some cases our solution is comparable or just slightly better than Azimov's algorithm (\textit{enzyme, eclass\_514en, go}), there are cases when our solution is significantly faster (\textit{go-hierarchy}, up to 9 times faster), and when Azimov's algorithm about 1.3 times faster (all memory aliases and \textit{geospecies} with \textit{Geo} query).
Thus we can conclude that our solution is performant enough because Azimov's algorithm is the fastest known practical CFPQ algorithm~\cite{10.1145/3398682.3399163} and the current version, which we use for evaluation, computes index only for single-path semantics, but our algorithm computes much more information (index for all paths) in a comparable time.


Best to our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first algorithm that provides information about all paths of interest (Azimov's algorithm computes information about only one path).
The direct comparison with other solutions is impossible, and we just estimate the running time of our algorithm for a small number of cases.
Namely, we extract all paths with length not greater than 20 edges between all pairs of vertices from indices created for graphs \textit{go} and \textit{eclass\_514en} and query $G_1$.
Paths extraction for one pair of vertices requires 2.64 seconds averaged over all pairs for \textit{go} graph. The~maximal time is 4699 seconds and 217 737 paths were extracted during this time. The average number of paths between two vertices is 184.
For \textit{eclass\_514en} paths extraction for one pair of vertices requires 1.27 seconds averaged over all pairs. The~maximal time is 8.04 seconds and only one path is extracted during this time. The average number of paths between two vertices is 3.
We can see that paths can be extracted in a reasonable time, but a detailed analysis of paths extraction algorithm performance depends on graphs structure.

%Comparison of paths extraction is presented in Figures~\ref{fig:geo_matrix_cfpq} and~\ref{fig:geo_tensors_cfpq}.
%While both methods demonstrate linear time on the length of the extracted path, our generic solution is more than 1000 times slower than Azimov's single path extraction procedure.
%We conclude that current generic all-path extraction procedure is not optimal for single path extraction.

\subsection{Conclusion}

We conclude that the proposed algorithm is applicable to real-world data processing: the algorithm allows one to solve both the reachability problem and to extract paths of interest in a reasonable time.
While index creation time (reachability query evaluation) is comparable with other existing solutions, the paths extraction procedure should be improved in the future. However, the state-of-the-art solution computes only reachability facts or a single-path semantics, whereas our algorithm computes data necessary to restore all possible paths (all-paths semantics).
Finally, a detailed comparison of the proposed solution with other algorithms for CFPQ and RPQ is required.

To summarize the overall evaluation, the proposed algorithm is applicable to both RPQ and CFPQ over real-world graphs.
Thus, the proposed solution is a promising unified algorithm for both RPQ and CFPQ evaluation.
