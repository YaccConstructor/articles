\section{Implementation Details}

To evaluate ideas described above we start a development of library named GraphBLAS\#\footnote{Sources of GraphBLAS\# on GiHub: \url{https://github.com/YaccConstructor/GraphBLAS-sharp}. Access date: 12.01.2021.}.

We use a Brahma.FSharp library for running time translation of F\# code to OpenCL C, and for translated kernels execution. 
Brahma.FSharp is based on code quotations, thus utilizes strong typing to provide more static code checks, and polymorphic first class functions for general highly abstract code creation.
Additionally, Brahma.FSharp provides special workflow builder to simplify heterogeneous programming and automate resource management.  

Abstraction layers which hides details of matrix representation and operations implementation.
Currently we are working on COO and CSR formats and respective operations.
