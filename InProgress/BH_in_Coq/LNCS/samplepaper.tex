\begin{abstract}
Formal language theory has a deep connection with such areas as static code analysis, graph database querying, formal verification, and compressed data processing.
Many application problems can be formulated in terms of languages intersection.
The Bar-Hillel theorem states that context-free languages are closed under intersection with a regular set.
This theorem has a constructive proof and thus provides a formal justification of correctness of the algorithms for applications mentioned above. 
Mechanization of the Bar-Hillel theorem, therefore, is both a fundamental result of formal language theory and a basis for the certified implementation of the algorithms for applications.
In this work, we present the mechanized proof of the Bar-Hillel theorem in Coq.
We generalize results of Gert Smolka and Jana Hofmann and use them as the base for our work.
