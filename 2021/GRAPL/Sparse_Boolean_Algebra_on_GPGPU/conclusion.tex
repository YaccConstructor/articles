\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we present a library for sparse Boolean linear algebra which implements such basic operations as matrix-matrix multiplication and element-wise matrix-matrix addition in both Cuda and OpenCL.
Evaluation shows that our Boolean-specific implementations faster and require less memory than generic, not the Boolean optimized, operations from state-of-the-art libraries.

The first direction of the future work is to integrate all parts (OpenCL and Cuda backends) into a single library and improve its documentation and prepare to publish.
Moreover, it is necessary to extend the library with other operations, including matrix-vector operations, masking, and so on.
As a result a Python package should be published.

Another important step is to evaluate the library on different algorithms and devices.
Namely, algorithms for RPQ and CFPQ should be implemented and evaluated on related data sets.
Also, it is necessary to evaluate OpenCL version on FPGA which may require additional technical effort and code changes.

Finally, we plan to discuss with GraphBLAS community possible ways to use our library as a backend for GraphBLAST or SuiteSparse in case of Boolean computations.
Moreover, it may be possible to use implemented algorithms as a foundation for generalization to arbitrary semirings.
